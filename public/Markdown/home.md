I'm Jana, a front-end developer who works on UI designs as well. If you wanted know about my proffesional skill, see me ***resume***.

Traveling and photography is one of my hobbies which I do mainly during the summer months. If you want to see photos just click on **"Gallery"**.

You can find the MiniGame section on my website, this section contains the basic game Tic-Tac-Toe.

*I hope you enjoy this game.*
