# Welcome to my website

*update: 13/03/22*

I'm Jana, a front-end developer who works on UI designs as well. If you wanted know about my proffesional skill, see me ***resume***.

Traveling and photography is one of my hobbies which I do mainly during the summer months. When you click on the images you will appear in the individual folders. If you want to see photos from individual places you have to click on **"All traveling"**.

You can find the MiniGames section on my website, this section contains the basic games Flappy bird and Tic-Tac-Toe.

*I hope you enjoy these games.*
